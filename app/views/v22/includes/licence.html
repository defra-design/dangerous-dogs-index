        Purpose
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">The Dangerous Dogs Index (DDI) Secure Access Licence (Licence) is a legally binding contract between you, your Police Force and the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), which is the controller that manages the DDI.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">It ensures that you and your Police Force are both aware of your legal responsibilities surrounding your access to the DDI – this is particularly important for your Police Force, because penalties may be levied at an organisational level in the event of a data incident.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Introduction
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The Licence is a per person, per Police Force Licence.
       </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You as a Licenced User, only need to apply for it once at your current Police Force – if you move Police Force and still require access to the DDI, you need to apply for a new Licence.
       </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        As a Licenced User, you must agree to this Licence’s terms and conditions before being issued credentials to access the DDI.
       </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Failure to agree to the terms and conditions of this Licence will mean that access to the DDI will be denied.
       </p>
