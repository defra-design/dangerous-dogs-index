       Meeting police needs
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">The team’s starting assumption was that a read-only version of the Index would meet the police user needs. For the first iteration of the dog and owner records for the police, we simply removed all the editing functionality.

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
       Download the record history
      </h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">Like the DDI team, the police needed to check the history of a record.
       </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Research during Alpha uncovered an additional need, the ability to download a copy of the records along with their history. To meet this need, we added the functionality to the ‘Check history’ page.

      <p class="govuk-body">We surfaced the new functionality on the dog and owner record pages, relabelling the ‘Check history’ button to ‘Check and download history’.

       Tracking CDO progress
      </h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">The police need a clear view of a CDO’s progress to help them effectively manage their kennel space. While processes vary by force, some DLOs assist dog owners in submitting the necessary information to Defra.
        </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Speeding up the CDO processing time helps reduce kennel time for dogs and frees up valuable space.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">We added a link on the dog record for the police to ‘Check CDO progress’.
