      First iteration of the search results
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      For the initial iteration of the search results, we decided which data to display through consultation with a key stakeholder. However, as we didn’t have access to the DDI team at that time, we were unable to conduct research into their specific needs.
     </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      One starting assumption was that, when searching, the team would be presented with a large number of search results and would need to scan them quickly to identify the correct record.
     </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      For this reason we developed a horizontal layout for the search results, aligning with common patterns used in other online search engines.
    </p>

      First usability tests
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The search results performed well in testing. We identified one simple improvement to assist some users – underlining the dog ED number to clearly indicate it as a link.
     </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Alpha assessment feedback
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
    The alpha assessment design assessor provided recommendations for improving the search results:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>review the use of the summary card component on the search results page</li>
      <li>check for sufficient colour contrast between the text and the background of the status labels</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      While refining the search results design, we also considered whether displaying the dog owner’s address would help users identify the correct result.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
     We tested the updated design with users during private beta.

      Outcome of usability testing 
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The new design was well received by users, as it eliminated the need to click into a dog or owner record to view the address. This allowed them to find the correct record more quickly.
     </p>
