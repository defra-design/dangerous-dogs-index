        Purpose
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">The Dangerous Dogs Index (DDI) Secure Access Licence (Licence) is a legally binding contract between you, your organisation and the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) which is the controller that manages the DDI. It ensures that you and your organisation are both aware of your legal responsibilities surrounding your access to the DDI – this is particularly important for your organisation, because penalties may be levied at an organisational level in the event of a data incident.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Introduction
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The Licence is a per person, per organisation Licence. You therefore only need to apply for it once whilst you are at your current organisation – if you were to move organisation and still require access to the DDI, then you would need to apply for a new licence.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        DDI Licenced Users must agree to this Licence before being issued credentials to access the DDI. Failure to agree to the terms and conditions of this Licence, means that access to the DDI will be denied.
      </p>
